	+ Key [t]erms, [t]opics
	
	+ [F]ocus
	
	+ [C]omment
	
	+ [P]erspective]

# Instruction words

* Account for

Give reasons for something.

* Analyse

	+ Focus on the 'how' and 'why' of an issue or topic. Do not simply describe or summarise. Break an issue into its constituent parts. Look in depth at each part using supporting arguments and evidence for and against as well as how these interrelate to one another.

* Compare 

	+ Find similarities and differences between two or more objects, ideas, events or theories.

* Contrast

	+ Similar to compare, but differences should be emphasised. Point out any differences which are particularly significant.

---

# Instruction words

* Criticise

	+ Assess the merit of something. Consider both good points and bad points and give the results of your analysis.

* Define

	+ Give precise meanings with key details. Examples may be useful. Bring to attention any problems posed with the definition and different interpretations that may exist.

* Describe 

	+ Provide a detailed explanation as to how and why something happens.. Recall specific details about size, cost, texture, appearance etc.

---

# Instruction words

* Discuss 

	+ Present a point of view after considering both sides of an issue or question. Your  opinion should be supported by arguments and evidence.

* Evaluate

	+ Consider both strengths and weaknesses and make a judgement.
	
* Examine

	+ Look in close detail and establish the key facts and important issues surrounding a topic. This should be a critical evaluation and you should try and offer reasons as to why the facts and issues you have identified are the most important, as well as explain the different ways they could be construed.


---

# Instruction words

* Explain

	+ Relate how something happens in the order in which it occurs, or, clarify reasons, causes and effects.
	
	
* Given an account of

	+ Means give a detailed description of something. Not to be confused with 'account for' which asks you not only what, but why something happened.
	
* Identify

	+ Determine what are the key points to be addressed and implications thereof.

---

# Instruction words

* Illustrate 

	+ Use concrete examples to demonstrate a point.

* Interpret

	+ Demonstrate your understanding of an issue or topic. Express in your own words. Examples may be useful.
	
* Justify

	+ Make a case by providing a body of evidence to support your ideas and points of view. In order to present a balanced argument, consider opinions which may run contrary to your own before stating your conclusion.


---

# Instruction words

* List

	+ Write your answer as an itemized series which may be in point form.

* Outline

	+ Provide main points and leave out minor details. Convey the main points placing emphasis on global structures and interrelationships rather than minute detail.

* Prove 

	+ Give factual evidence, examples or clear logical reasons which demonstrate the validity of a statement/idea.


---

# Instruction words

* Relate 

	+ Tell the story in clear sequence, or, show how things are connected or similar to each other.

* Review

	+ Examine a subject critically, analysing and commenting on the main points.

* Show how

	+ Present, in a logical order, and with reference to relevant evidence the stages and combination of factors that give rise to something.

---

# Instruction words

* State

	+ Present the main points in brief, clear sequence. Refer to evidence and examples where appropriate.

* Summarise 

	+ Give the main points or facts in condensed form. Brief or general examples will normally suffice for this kind of answer.

* To what extent

	+ Consider both sides, make a judgment and defend it. Similar to evaluate or discuss. Explore alternative explanations where they exist.

* Trace

	+ Relate the progress, development or history of a subject

---

# Plan your time

* When planning to use the time available, you MUST:

	+ make sure that you are answering the right number of questions

	+ divide your time according to the marks of the questions

	+ write down the finishing time for each question

	+ try to allow for 10 minutes checking time at the end.

* Stick to your plan.

---

# Choose your question order

*  Consider deciding what order you are going to complete your questions: 

	+ It is good idea to attempt the questions you feel most confident with first.  

	+ Make sure you complete the compulsory questions. 


---

# Memory dump

* Write down the relevant key words (points) you can remember on the essay questions you will answer. For example, your answer might have five main points, so jot them down, with a few key words under each point.

* Brainstorm ideas and plan your answer. You could try using a mind map to help with this. 


---

# Start writing

* Write as much as possible in the time you have planned.

* For the structure of the answer follow the structure of the question. 

	+ Develop a thesis statement from the question and include it in your introduction.  

	+ Structure the points in the body paragraphs so that one point follows the other logically and clearly.  

* As a general rule, one paragraph = one point, supported by an example, explanation, and evidence.

* Leave a few lines of between each paragraph, as you may want to add additional information later.

* Try to write neatly and proofread as you go.

---

# Instruction words of previous examinations

* Explain

* Discuss

* Highlight (by case studies)

---

# Memorise and revise

* Phase one: Summarising and understanding 

	+ Study summaries, lists, flash cards etc. Condense the information you have gathered using study summaries. Use your own words, or present the information visually. (You recall I have asked you to do mindmaps or the Excel table.) 

* Phase two: Storing and retrieval activities 

	+ Acronyms, rhymes, talking out loud, verbal associations. Use SQ3R and talking out loud.

* Phase three: Practice and application 

	+ Practice answering questions (speaking out loud and/or practising writing down answers) 

---

# SQ3R study strategy

* Survey

	+ Look over the set of notes you are about to revise. Read headings, diagrams, graphs. This step acts as an advance organiser as it activates relevant vocabulary.

* Question

	+ Generate some questions about the content which will help you focus your study, e.g. What are some the differences between the two main theories? What are some of the examples of ...?
	
* Read

	+ Read the notes using a slower in-depth reading style. Pause frequently to think about what you have just read. Then read on. Read with a pencil and make margin notes or underline words or phrases which are important (like definitions). 

---

# SQ3R study strategy

* Recite

	+ Make notes on the sections you have just read from memory. If you are going over study notes you have already made - make lists of main points or 'talk aloud'. 

* Review

	+ Check your recalled notes against the section that you read. Add in anything that you omitted. Put an asterisk (*) by it so that you can attend to this point when you go through these notes the next time

    taking into account all risk factors including those relating to its
    customers, countries or geographic areas, products, services,
    transactions or delivery channels."

    been entrusted with prominent public functions including the
    following: heads of state, government and parliament members,
    members of the judiciary and directors of state-owned enterprises.
    PEPs are categorized as high-risk money-laundering customers,
    because it is assumed that there is a heightened threat of
    corruption and embezzlement associated with them."

# UK National Risk Assessment of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing

&gt; "The effectiveness of the supervisory regime and approach in the UK
    is inconsistent. There are rooms for improvement including in
    understanding and applying a risk-based approach to supervision and
    in providing a credible deterrent. Data is not yet shared between
    supervisors freely or frequently enough, which exposes some
    supervised sectors where there are overlaps in supervision."

---

# UK National Risk Assessment of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing

* The private sector holds much of the data needed to succeed in the
    fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Increasing
    collaboration between law enforcement agencies, supervisors and the
    private sector is essential to help prevent and detect money
    laundering and terrorist financing, and protect the UK from their
    effects.
